## Introduction to API3 for ETHPrague Hackers

### Understanding API3

[API3](https://api3.org/) is a collaborative project that delivers traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. It is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), namely the [API3 DAO](https://api3.org/dao).

- [API3 Docs](https://docs.api3.org/)
- [Github](https://github.com/api3dao/)
- [Medium](https://medium.com/@api3)

Airnode is a first-party oracle that pushes off-chain API data to an on-chain contract. Airnode is a serverless function that lets API providers easily run their own oracle nodes. That way, they can provide data to any on-chain dApp that's interested in their services without an intermediary.

### dAPIs: first-party data feeds 

API3 uses first-party oracles to power [dAPIs](https://docs.api3.org/explore/dapis/what-are-dapis.html). dAPIs are secure, transparent, and cost-efficient data feeds that connect smart contracts directly to first-party data sources.

Self-funded dAPIs give DeFi builders access to over **100 forex & crypto dAPIs that serve real-time market data** to 10 networks (and 11 testnets).

### API3 Demo Project: Payments dApp 

This tutorial takes users through accessing and integrating dAPIs into a simple payments dApp. This quick start guide should take less than 30mins to follow.

<!--### QRNG - API3's Quantum Random Number Generator

API3 QRNG is a public utility we provide with the courtesy of Australian National University (ANU). It is powered by an Airnode hosted by ANU Quantum Random Numbers, meaning that it is a first-party service. It is served as a public good and is free of charge (apart from the gas costs), and it provides ‘true’ quantum randomness via an easy-to-use solution when requiring RNG on-chain.

# Hackathon Challenge: Using API3's First-party Oracles to power DeFi dApps

### Overview

We want builders to explore decentralized financial services that can be built using API3's first-party oracles and datafeeds.

Outside of DeFi, we will also accept submissions from dApps that use Airnode or QRNG that facilitate a proper use-case. Participants are free to implement their own ideas.

### Potential Ideas

- Prediction market
- Lending application
- Perpetual swaps
- Derivative protocols 
- P2P transactional bots
- Decentralized insurance protocols
- Algorithmic stablecoin

## Judging criteria

Participants may submit a maximum of 1 project by the hackathon deadline. After submission, projects will be judged by the following criteria:

- **Real-world Functionality**: How well does the project work? Does it meet the minimum requirements?

- **Technical Difficulty**: How technically challenging was it to build the project?

- **Originality**: How original is the idea? How much does it differ from other existing solutions?

- **Design**: How well-designed is the project? Is it easy to use? Is it visually appealing?

- **BONUS** - Adding functionality to the Airnode protocol that will improve performance, interoperability, or further develop use cases.

After judges complete the evaluations, the top 2 projects will be selected based on their weighted scores to receive prizes. Winners will be announced shortly after the hackathon ends.

## Prizes

|       Position       |     Prize    |
|----------------------|--------------|
|  First place winner  | $3000 USDC   |
|   Second runner up   |   $1000 USDC  |
|     |     |
